# Image-Caption-Generator

I have develop a image caption generator usinf flickr dataset in python.



You saw an image and your brain can easily tell what the image is about, but can a computer tell what the image is representing? This is what we are going to implement in this Python based project where we will use deep learning techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks and a type of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) together.

What is Image Caption Generator?
Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.
